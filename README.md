 Understanding Key API and Software Concepts
 
1: API (Application Programming Interface)
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software systems to communicate. It defines how requests and responses are formatted, enabling seamless integration of external services or functionalities. APIs are widely used in web development, mobile apps, and data exchange.

2:SDK (Software Development Kit)
An SDK is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation designed to help developers build applications for a specific platform or service. It often includes prebuilt functions and APIs to simplify complex tasks.

3:Web APIs
Web APIs are APIs accessible over the internet using protocols like HTTP. They are commonly used for tasks such as retrieving data (REST APIs) or enabling real-time communication (WebSocket APIs). Examples include the Google Maps API and Twitter API.

4:Library APIs
Library APIs are sets of functions provided by software libraries that developers can use to perform specific tasks within their applications. For example, NumPy in Python provides APIs for numerical computations.

5:Prompting and Completion
Prompting involves providing input to a language model (e.g., GPT) as a query or instruction. Completion refers to the AI's generated response, which could be text, code, or other output based on the prompt. This mechanism powers features like chatbots, content generation, and interactive Q&A systems.
